Description: module to find differences between files (XS accelerated)
 Algorithm::Diff::XS is a Perl diff utility module based on Joe Schaefer's
 excellent but not very well-known Algorithm::LCS module, with a drop-in
 interface identical to Algorithm::Diff.
 .
 Note that only the LCSidx function is optimized in XS at the moment, which
 means only compact_diff will get significantly faster for large data sets,
 while diff and sdiff will run in identical speed as Algorithm::Diff.
